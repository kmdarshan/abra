# ABCodeChallenge

I have tried to keep the implementation very simple. It supports both potrait and landscape. <br>
I have separated the projects into different components. Its easy for anyone working on the code to understand. <br>
Wrote unit tests for NSDate. This can be extended for other classes too.<br>
Maintained a header file to define constants. This can be extended to store constants which are used throughout the project.<br>
If your having issues running the PODs, try updating the PODs using the command 'pod update'. This should fix it.
