# ABCodeChallenge

I have tried to keep the implementation very simple. It supports both potrait and landscape. <br>
I have separated the projects into different components. Its easy for anyone working on the code to understand. <br>
Wrote unit tests for NSDate. This can be extended for other classes too.
